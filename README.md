# 🕳️ No Ending  
### *"Sometimes, the hardest thing is to stop."*

**No Ending** is a minimalist, existential experience built on a **custom C engine** with **Lua scripting** for game logic.  
There are no levels, no scores, and no clear goals — only a quiet world that keeps moving forward,  
asking the player one question:  
> *“How long will you keep going?”*

## 🌌 Overview

**No Ending** is not a traditional game — it’s an *experience.*  
The player moves endlessly through a dark, looping space.  
At unpredictable moments, subtle messages appear, reflecting on persistence, meaning, and the quiet weight of continuing.  

There’s no real ending.  
After a long, uncertain time, the screen fades to black and shows one final line:  
> “You’ve reached nothing. Yet here you are.”  
Then, without notice, the game restarts — silently — as if nothing ever happened.

It’s a story told through **repetition, atmosphere, and absence.**  
The more the player continues, the more the experience feels personal — as if the game is aware of their endurance.

## 💭 Vision

> A game that never ends.  
> A story that never begins.  
>  
> You walk.  
> The world watches.  
> And somewhere in the silence,  
> you start to wonder — *why?*

## ✨ Core Idea

> “Sometimes, the hardest thing is to stop.”  

That line defines both the **player** and the **developer**.  
No Ending isn’t about finishing — it’s about continuing, exploring, and creating something that mirrors life itself.  
A loop without answers, but filled with meaning.
